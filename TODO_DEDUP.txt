## Priority Order:
1. Rules with multiple test files (likely to have cross-file duplicates)
2. Rules with many test functions (likely to have within-file duplicates)
3. Rules with generic test names (need naming improvements)

## Notes:
- Focus on within-file duplicates and naming improvements
- Check for functionally identical test cases with different variable names
- Improve generic test names like "test_*" to be more descriptive
- Consolidate tests that test the same pattern with minimal variations
